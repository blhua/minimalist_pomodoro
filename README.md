# minimalist_pomodoro
A minimalist visual pomodoro timer using Python tkinter

This Python Tkinter-based GUI is based on the popular Pomodoro technique for work productivity: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique
* The Pomodoro technique breaks work sessions up into cycles made of up two phases: 25 minutes of dedicated work with no distractions, followed by a 5 minute rest period. After four Pomodoro cycles have been completed, take a long break of 20-30 minutes.

This minimalist pomodoro is based on Gary Peng's pomodoro timer that focuses on a simple, sleek, and quiet physical timer that shows the user the progress of the Pomodoro cycle via a set of led lights that each respresent a fifth of the Pomodoro period: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/garypeng/quickstarter-pod-a-focus-tool-for-the-digital-age

In this version, Gary Peng's concept is translated to a simple Tkinter GUI with a minimal desktop footprint.
